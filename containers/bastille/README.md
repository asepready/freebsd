To install from the FreeBSD package repository:

quarterly repository may be older version

To install from source (donâ€™t worry, no compiling):

sysrc bastille_rcorder=YES # Optional
```

```
This method will install the latest files from GitHub directly onto your system. It is verbose about the files it installs (for later removal), and also has a make uninstall target. You may need to manually copy the .sample config into place before Bastille will run. (ie; /usr/local/etc/bastille/bastille.conf.sample)

Note: installing using this method overwrites the version variable to match that of the source revision commit hash.
