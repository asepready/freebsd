# What is AppJail?
AppJail is an open-source BSD-3 licensed framework entirely written in sh(1) and C to create isolated, portable and easy to deploy environments using FreeBSD jails that behaves like an application.

Its goals are to simplify life for sysadmins and developers by providing a unified interface that automates the jail workflow by combining the base FreeBSD tools.

AppJail offers simple ways to do complex things.

# Features
- Easy to use.
- Parallel startup (Healthcheckers, Jails & NAT).
- UFS and ZFS support.
- RACCT/RCTL support.
- NAT support.
- Port expose - network port forwarding into jail.
- IPv4 and IPv6 support.
- DHCP and SLAAC support.
- Virtual networks - A jail can be on several virtual networks at the same time.
- Bridge support.
- VNET support
- Deploy your applications much easier using Makejail!
- Netgraph support.
- LinuxJails support.
- Supports thin and thick jails.
- TinyJails - Experimental feature to create a very stripped down jail that is very useful to distribute.
- Startup order control - Using priorities and the boot flag makes management much easier.
- Jail dependency support.
- Initscripts - Make your jails interactive!
- Backup your jails using tarballs or raw images (ZFS only) with a single command.
- Modular structure - each command is a unique file that has its own responsability in AppJail. This makes AppJail - maintenance much easier.
- Table interface - many commands have a table-like interface, which is very familiar to many sysadmin tools.
- No databases - each configuration is separated in each entity (networks, jails, etc.) which makes maintenance much easier.
- Healthcheckers - Monitor your jails and make sure they are healthy!
- Images - Your jail in a single file!
- DEVFS support - Dynamic device management!
